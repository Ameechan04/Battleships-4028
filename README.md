HOW TO RUN

1. Have an updated version of Java installed on your device
2. download the .JAR file
3. open command prompt
   IN COMMAND PROMPT:
a. change the directory to the download location of the .jar file (I am assuming that if you are accessing a project on GitHub you are aware of how to do this already)
b. enter: java -jar Battleship4028.jar
c. the program should now run

To access the source code download the Java Class files.
They are all necessary.
The overwhelming bulk of the code is in the Game.class file.

TODO:
1. improve versatility by making the input not so damn fragile to wrong type inputs
2. add comments
3. allow ships of various size
4. add an additional level of difficulty by having the bot check the surrounding spaces when it hits
5. add a functional User Interface using JFrames
